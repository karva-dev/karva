    Sync tests are submitted to a single-worker ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor``;

    against the test and the worker thread is abandoned (Python has no safe
    way to interrupt arbitrary code, so any side effects already started will
    continue).

    Async tests are wrapped in ``asyncio.wait_for``, which cancels the
    coroutine via ``CancelledError`` when the limit elapses.

    Fixture setup runs before the timeout starts, so slow fixtures do not
    count toward the limit.
